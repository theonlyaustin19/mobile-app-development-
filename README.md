Project Title: Wellness Habit Tracker App

Client: Local Wellness Spa and Gym

Platform: Android (using Android Studio)

Design Purpose: To visually represent the structure, layout, and functionality of a mobile habit tracking app, aligning with client requirements.

This document presents the initial design for a bespoke habitat  tracking mobile application requested by a local wellness spa and gym. The purpose of the app is to help users monitor key daily health habits, including water intake, workout frequency, and workout timing. The design stage focuses on planning how the app will function, how it will look, and how it meets the client’s key requirements while demonstrating creativity and user-focused thinking.

## REFINEMENTS 

After receiving feedback from a friend, I made targeted refinements to improve the overall user experience and engagement of the app. First, I added a goal completion alert to the Water Tracker screen. When the user reaches their daily target (e.g., 8 glasses), a message appears saying, “Goal Achieved! Great job!” to motivate and reward them. I also enhanced the app’s visuals by introducing a glass-filling icon that updates dynamically based on progress starting from empty, then half-full, to completely full providing a more intuitive and visual way for users to track their hydration. Lastly, I improved the Main Menu screen by making the motivational quote rotate randomly from a selection of positive messages. This adds variety and keeps the experience fresh each time the user opens the app. These refinements were directly informed by the review and help make the app more engaging and user-friendly.
